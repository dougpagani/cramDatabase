# cramDatabase

The core constituents of the database reside in "mySQL/".

The database may be setup in two ways primarily:

1. Importing the dump.sql
2. Manually:
	a. Forward-engineering the model
	b. running the command in your favorite shell:
		> mysql < runScripts.sql

Everything is contained within that. Please check that the privleges for the rstudio user are in accordance with the outline in the final project report.
